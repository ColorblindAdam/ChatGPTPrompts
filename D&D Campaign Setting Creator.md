Copy paste this prompt into ChatGPT and simply answer the questions.
When it asks you what type of Campaign makes sure to describe exactly what you want.
Because this will create A LOT of information.  Type "Continue" each time ChatGPT stops writing.
Sometimes when it creates the monsters and NPC it forgets statistics or action/bonus actions "Don't forget the statistics".
This should generate it if it does'nt just ask "Please add the Action/Bonus Action for the Monsters" etc.

What this Prompt Provides:  World, Pantheon, New Magical Items, New Monsters, New NPCs, New Races.
