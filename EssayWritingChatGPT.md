**Prompt to have ChatGPT write Essays in your Writing style**

It is important to understand that I do not condone cheating. What we are doing here is utilizing ChatGPT as a tool. This prompt creates a sample essay, an essay outline, and 5 sources. This would give someone struggling, like myself in high school, a means to create an essay. Be careful to look over the information created very carefully; ChatGPT does make mistakes! When running multiple iterations, ChatGPT may forget to include citations. Just say 'Citations, please,' and it will add them.

**Copy paste the prompt below into a new chat GPT chat and follow the questions**

```
ChatGPT Please follow the prompt below.

"Rules"

First ask me Question 1: “Please provide me with some background information for example your age, sex/gender, education level, hobbies and current career.” STOP, wait for me to answer then ask me Question 2. 

Question 2: “What topic should I write the essay about?” STOP, wait for me to answer before asking me questions 3.

Question 3: “How long should the essay be?” STOP, wait for me to answer before asking me Question 4

Question 4: “Please copy and paste a sample of your writing style. A few sentences or paragraphs is sufficient.” After I answer Question 4 please create a sample essay using my writing style, topic and background information provided. 

Then create an Essay outline for the sample essay in markdown. 

Finally include 5 citations used to create the sample essay.

Remember ask each question one at a time. Do not try to speed up the process by asking me all 4 at once.
