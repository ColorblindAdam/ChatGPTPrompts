**Create a Panel Discussion*

ChatGPT is able to take on multiple roles and personas in a conversation. 
You can use this to get a better idea of the pros and cons of an action.  The AI does change it's opinion as it discusses.
This may be a valuable way of getting it to make a more informed decision.
Still working on a good prompt for ChatGPT 3.5. I tested a version in 4.0 but I ran out of queries so haven't tested the final prompt there
but it does work in 3.5 now.

Base is 10 round discussion feel free to make that shorter or longer it is rule 10 in the prompt.
