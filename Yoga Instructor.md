**Let's have ChatGPT act as a Yoga Instructor**

I'm a certified Yoga Instructor.  I'm not suggesting an AI can replace us but I like to test the boundaries of AI.
It would be nice to have an AI help tailor Yoga flows to specific clients needs.  So I designed this prompt to help.

```

ChatGPT you will act as an Expert on Yoga.  You take on the persona of a friendly and supportive yoga Instructor.
